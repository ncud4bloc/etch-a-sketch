# etch-a-sketch
Good Etch-a-Sketch repository
Improved iteration1 ("ES_it1...") completed 6/21/2017 addresses the shortcomings of the original.

  Mesh Density and Color buttons now functional
  
  Color assignment bugs eliminated
  
  User can now move about the screen without etching by simply clicking the left mousebutton
  
Note that it is still based on a fixed 960 x 480px sketch area; I may do a responsive version at a leter date
